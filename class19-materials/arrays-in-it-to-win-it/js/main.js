//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ['Star Wars', 'Empire Strikes Back', 'Return of the Jedi']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

let movie = movies[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

let mLength = movies.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

let mLast = movies.at(-1)

These are my copies of materials from [100 Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/)'
([Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/learnwithleon)) 2022 cohort.

They include any lab work and homework I've done. If you're interested in
the original materials, read the 100 Devs link above and consider joining
the Learn w/ Leon and Friends Discord where the materials are posted in
the \#follow-along-materials channel.

I do not represent 100 Devs or Leon; I'm just a fan who's decided to join
the cohort and catch up with and follow the class materials to keep fresh
and practice and meet others.
